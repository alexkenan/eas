# Essential Air Service
*Plotly map for the US DOT's Essential Air Service subsidy program*

Not many people know about [Essential Air Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_Air_Service) (EAS).

EAS is a US Department of Transportation program that is designed to provide commercial air service to rural communities that could not otherwise sustain service. As of September 2020, there are a total of 219 subsidized routes: 75 in Alaska, 2 in Hawaii, 1 in Puerto Rico, and 141 in the continental United States. The program paid out about $335 million in funding in 2020. If you were to fly on a route serviced by SkyWest, American Eagle, Alaska Airlines, or another "major" airline, you would not know that you were on a subsidized route. Other, smaller routes are serviced with turboprop aircraft that may not offer a seamless connection to major airline service.
